## Calibration

The Soil Moisture Sensor (SMS) calibration values will be adjusted in the [a relative link](user/repo/Macetron/include/config/mainConfig.h):
1. Uncomment the "CALIBRATION_MODE" and comment the other modes to start the calibration.
2. Leave the SMS out of the soil or a water source, and modify the define "SMS_DRY_CALIBRATION_VALUE" with the average value of analogRead read from the screen.
3. Insert the sensor up the line into a water source, and modify the define "SMS_WET_CALIBRATION_VALUE" with the average value of analogRead read from the screen.
